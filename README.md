### A PowerShell Module to generate GIFs

CaptureIT can generate GIFs of both the actively selected window or your entire desktop

NOTE: There are a few bugs still but the major work is complete.  I will continue to update this as I go, but please submit Pull Requests if you find any bugs or issues.

Some of this code was borrowed from Boe Prox's Take-Screenshot PowerShell Function.
